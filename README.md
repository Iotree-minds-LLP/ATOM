## Automatic Assessment of Pavement Condition based on road photographs

### Problem given

  Works constructed under the PMGSY scheme are to be maintained by the contractor as per the PMGSY guidelines. Pavement Condition Index is required to be performed to identify the road condition and further to take the maintenance or upgradation of the work. Through EMARG and PMGSY-III, NRIDA has collected a vast collection of pictures of roads. These pictures are collected while doing inspection of roads or collection of PCI through visual inspections. An AI assisted module would be able to automatically assess the picture and identify common issues such as shoulder clearance, potholes, road furniture etc. Requirement is of a solution where there should be a provision to capture the chainage wise pavement condition index. Use of open source software and existing neural network is encouraged. Train a machine learning model, computer vision etc. which is able to identify common issues with pavement based on photograph(s) per road alone. Data Required: Yes (Annotated images to be released by NRIDA) Data Required: Yes (Annotated images to be released by NRIDA)
